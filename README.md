# Tipster Demo

Here is the pre work app for Intro to iOS class. This is a simple Tip calculator

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Required: User can enter bill amount, select tip % and see the total
 * [x] Required: Added Settings page - user can select different tip percentages to show in main view
 * [x] Optional: Better user inteface - along with total, app shows the total split among 2, 3 and 4 people  
 * [x] Optional: Remember the bill amount across app restarts. If user returns 10 minutes later, then bill amount will be cleared
 * [x] Optional: Added animation to hide/show results view when bill amount is entered
 
Notes:

Spent some time making the UI work across multiple phone resolutions by playing around with the RelativeLayout.
